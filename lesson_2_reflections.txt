What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
+ The directory in which git init operates becomes automatically a git repository.  (.git) folder
is created and now changes are being tracked. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
+ The staging area allows us to add files to be commited for changes. If a logical change modifies
several files they can be grouped by adding them to the staging area and then commit changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When trying out experimental features, or any work to be done parallel to the master or main branch. Branching allows us
to copy the master branch and make modifications while preserving the master branch intact.
