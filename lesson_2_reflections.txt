What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
+ The directory in which git init operates becomes automatically a git repository.  (.git) folder
is created and now changes are being tracked. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
+ The staging area allows us to add files to be commited for changes. If a logical change modifies
several files they can be grouped by adding them to the staging area and then commit changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When trying out experimental features, or any work to be done parallel to the master or main branch. Branching allows us
to copy the master branch and make modifications while preserving the master branch intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
+ Diagrams help you better visualize a branch structure by placing commits into a graph,
this way we can accurately see the workflow of our project.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
+ Merging two branches together means that the latest commits in each branch will be combined as a commit in one of the two branches. This new commit will have the code of both parent commits merged.
The merge commit is represented in the diagram as a child of the latest commits in each branch, because
that´s wha´t GIT is doing in the background while merging.
