When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
+ Whenever I need to collaborate with other people
+ Whenever I wanÂ´t to publish make code and make it available to the public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
+ You might want to check if the changes made by other people should reflect on your local repository!
